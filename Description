# Gesture-and-Voice-Hybrid-Interface
The "Gesture Voice Hybrid Interface" project aims to revolutionize the traditional computer input mechanisms by replacing the conventional mouse and keyboard with a more intuitive and natural human-computer interaction (HCI) system.The mouse and keyboard are the marvellous inventions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) technology.Currently, wireless mouse and keyboard still uses devices and is not free of devices completely, since it is using a battery for power and a dongle to connect it to the PC.In the proposed Al virtual mouse system, this limitation can be overcome by employing a simple webcam for capturing of hand gestures using computer vision.This interface leverages hand gestures and voice commands to perform standard computing operations.The suggested system will make use of OpenCV, Media pipe and Python as well as other Packages.
